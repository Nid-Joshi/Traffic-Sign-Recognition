# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
A Comparative Analysis in Classifying Traffic Sign Images through Convolutional Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons

Requirements:

- torch==2.2.0
- torchvision===0.17.0
- numpy===1.24.3
- opencv-python==4.9.0.80
- scikit-image==0.20.0
- scikit-learn==1.3.0
- pandas==1.5.3
- matplotlib==3.7.1
- seaborn==0.12.2



Setup_instructions:

1. Code file Details:
	- Main code file (CNN_MLP_Traffic_Signal_Recognition.ipynb)
	- Code file to load the saved models and test them (Load_and_Test.ipynb)
	- Run codes with outputs in pdf format (CNN_MLP_Traffic_Signal_Recognition.pdf & Load_and_Test.pdf)
2. Install the packages mentioned under requirements above.
3. Launch Jupyter notebooks and change directory (cd) to the extracted folder
4. Run the CNN_MLP_Traffic_Signal_Recognition.ipynb code file to train, test and evaluate the models.
5. If needed, run Load_and_Test.ipynb to test and evaluate the saved models on Test dataset (data to be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data).
